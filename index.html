    <h1>Variant Grants</h1>
    <p>We fund people and projects that increase public interest in engineered biology.</p>

    <p>100% of donations go directly into grants. We support individuals and small teams working across biology, education, storytelling, aesthetics, and tools. We share all grantee work publicly. If we fund a project, we also write about it.</p>

    <p>We believe in bioabundance. That means more: more people in science, more public understanding, more experimentation, and more joy. Our microgrants go toward art, essays, experiments, and infrastructure that help biology feel less institutionalâ€”and more human.</p>
